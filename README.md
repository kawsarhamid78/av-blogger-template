AV Template
===========

A Blogger template inspired from a wix blog theme, forked from the blogger simple template.

The theme is responsive with the help of Bootstrap, aimed to be highly sharable on Facebook, Google and Twitter implementing the latest meta-tags that these services love.

Installing
----------

Download the files on your machine as a zip or if you're familiar with the git console clone this repo.

Then in the administration panel of your Blogger blog click on the `Template` (left panel), in the upper right corner click on the `Backup \ Restore`. In the popout upload the template file and finally click upload. Voila.

Unfortunately, so far, there is no solution to upload/download the template automatically, maybe `curl`, but is a very very long fetch.
